Welcome to the Healthcare Investment Experiment! In this simulation, you will decide how to allocate your time between health investment and enjoyment investment to optimize your life enjoyment. Your health will naturally decline over time, and you will face random health shocks that can affect your health and enjoyment.

# Integration with C++ dynamic program
# This is where you would call your C++ program or API to get the updated health, enjoyment, and shock event based on the user's decision.
# For example:
# health, enjoyment, shock_event = cpp_simulation.update(decision)

# Displaying the health decline curve and shock probability indicator would require additional logic and visualization tools, potentially integrating with the C++ model's output.
